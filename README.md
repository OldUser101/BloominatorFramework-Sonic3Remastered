# sonic 3 & knuckles in bloominator framework

im working on an open-source, easy-to-mod version of sonic 3 ‚Äî no unmodifiable hardcoded parts or renderhooking required (looking at YOU S3AIR)!

-- **planned features**
- **multiple gameplay modes:** full support for widescreen, ultrawide & 4:3
  - accommodations for widescreen (like moving the fire breath boss and adjusting the data select screen & other stuff)
- **remastered ost:** idk what to do here i cant find a full remastered track on yt and im no producer or know how to deal with music ‡≤†__‡≤†
- **smooth 60+ fps gameplay:**  
  - possibly with interpolation for extra smoothness  
  - fixes for movement smoothing on things like aiz badniks, swings, and blue spheres (like sonic mania/3k origins)
- **features i definetly dont and wont know how to add but if anybody wants it then i might add it:**  
  - a classic mode (game in 4:3)  
  - an original mode (using integrated blastem with a user-supplied sonic 3k rom)

i basically havent made any progress on either of these so if someone can help me out it would be greatly appreciated!!!!
